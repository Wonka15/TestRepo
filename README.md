##  Collaborator Branches

To keep our work organized, everyone has their own branch:

| Role                | Branch Name    | What to do here?                           |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 🟦 William (Code & Art)| `William-DEV` | Add code, features, AND art assets          |

**Always make changes in your own branch!**
